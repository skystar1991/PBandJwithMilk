I first tasted JavaScript in Highschool, then I did a bit more in the programming class.

1) EvenOdd

a recursive function telling you if a number is even or odd. modulus(%) is not allowed.

EX)

console.log(EvenOdd(10));

Even

console.Log(EvenOdd(255));

Odd

console.Log(EvenOdd("one"));

Not a valid number


2) MyMathFunction

a function will take two numbers and function name; Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide.

EX)

console.log(MyMathFunction(10, 10, Multiply));

100

console.log(MyMathFunction(10, 0, Divide));

Cannot Divide by 0!


3) SortMyArray

a function will sort the array from smallest to largest.


4) myFib

a recursion function to compute the Fibonacci number of n.
